			<h3>Local Processing</h3>
			<p>Dash Pal Pro: Race&Track Tools is designed to protect your privacy completely. All core functionality operates locally on your device:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>GPS Processing:</strong> All location and speed data is processed locally on your device</li>
				<li><strong>Motion Sensors:</strong> Accelerometer and gyroscope data is processed in real-time locally for G-force calculations</li>

				<li><strong>Trip Data:</strong> All trip statistics, distance, duration, and route information remain on your device</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>We do not upload, access, store, or transmit your location data, trip information, or sensor readings to our servers.</strong> Your travel data remains completely private and under your control.</p>

			<h3>Location and Sensor Access</h3>

			<h2>Your Privacy Rights and Choices</h2>
			<p>Since we do not collect any personal data, traditional privacy rights such as data access, correction, or deletion do not apply. However, you maintain complete control over:</p>
			<ul>

				<li><strong>Motion & Fitness:</strong> You can control motion access in iOS Settings → Privacy → Motion & Fitness</li>
				<li><strong>App Deletion:</strong> You can delete the app at any time, which removes all app data from your device</li>
