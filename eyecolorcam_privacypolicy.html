We do not upload, store, or transmit your photos, videos, or any personal data to our servers. We do not track users or collect personal information.

			<h2>Media Privacy and Local Processing</h2>

			<h3>Local Processing</h3>
			<p>Eye Color Cam is designed to protect your privacy completely. All core functionality operates locally on your device:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>AR Eye Color Effects:</strong> All augmented reality processing and eye color effects are rendered locally on your device</li>
				<li><strong>Photo & Video Processing:</strong> All photo and video editing with eye color effects occurs entirely on your device</li>
				<li><strong>Camera Processing:</strong> Live camera preview with AR effects is processed in real-time locally</li>
				<li><strong>Media Storage:</strong> All processed photos and videos are saved directly to your device's photo library</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>We do not upload, access, store, or transmit your photos, videos, camera or face data to our servers.</strong> Your media content remains completely private and under your control.</p>

			<h3>Camera and Photo Library Access</h3>
			<p>The App requires access to your device camera and photo library to function:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> Used for live AR preview and capturing photos/videos with eye color effects</li>
				<li><strong>Photo Library Access:</strong> Used for importing existing photos to apply eye color effects and saving processed media</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This access is used solely for the stated AR functionality. We do not access other photos, videos, or use your camera for any purpose other than applying eye color effects.</p>

			<h2>Data Collection</h2>

			<h3>No Personal Data Collection</h3>
			<p>Eye Color Cam does not collect any personal data whatsoever. We do not collect:</p>

			<h2>In-App Purchase Information</h2>
			<p>Eye Color Cam offers a single in-app purchase to unlock all 30 eye colors and remove the watermark. Payment processing is handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or store your payment information. Apple may share limited information about your purchase with us, such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Purchase status (purchased or not purchased)</li>
				<li>Anonymous transaction identifiers for verification</li>
			</ul>

			<p>We do not receive any personal payment information, credit card details, or identifiable purchase data.</p>

			<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

			<h3>Apple Services</h3>
			<p>The App integrates with Apple services including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>App Store Connect:</strong> For in-app purchase management</li>
				<li><strong>ARKit:</strong> For augmented reality eye tracking and effects (processed locally on device)</li>
				<li><strong>Vision Framework:</strong> For facial recognition and eye detection (processed locally on device)</li>
				<li><strong>Photos Framework:</strong> For accessing and saving photos and videos</li>
			</ul>

			<p>All processing through these frameworks occurs locally on your device. No data is transmitted to Apple or us through these services.</p>

			<h2>Use of Your Personal Data</h2>
			<p>Since we do not collect any personal data, we do not use, process, store, or share any of your personal information. The app functions entirely locally on your device without any data transmission to external servers.</p>

			<h2>Your Privacy Rights and Choices</h2>
			<p>Since we do not collect any personal data, traditional privacy rights such as data access, correction, or deletion do not apply. However, you maintain complete control over:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Camera Access</strong>: You can revoke camera permissions in iOS Settings > Eye Color Cam > Camera</li>
				<li><strong>Photo Library Access</strong>: You can manage photo access in iOS Settings > Eye Color Cam > Photos</li>
				<li><strong>App Deletion</strong>: You can delete the app at any time, which removes all app data</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Data Retention</h2>
			<p>We do not retain any of your data because we do not collect any data. All photos and videos processed by the app are:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Processed locally on your device</li>
				<li>Saved directly to your device's photo library under your control</li>
				<li>Never transmitted to or stored on our servers</li>
				<li>Managed entirely by you through your device's photo management system</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Data Security</h2>
			<p>Your privacy and security are protected through our no-data-collection approach:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Local Processing Only:</strong> All AR effects and photo/video processing occurs on your device</li>
				<li><strong>No Data Transmission:</strong> Nothing is sent to external servers</li>
				<li><strong>No Data Storage:</strong> We don't store any user data on our systems</li>
				<li><strong>Complete User Control:</strong> You maintain full control over all photos and videos</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
			<p>Since we do not collect any personal data, there are no international data transfers to be concerned about. All processing occurs locally on your device regardless of your location.</p>

			<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
			<p>Our Service does not collect any data from users of any age, including children under 13. Since no data collection occurs, there are no special considerations needed for children's privacy beyond the standard parental controls available on iOS devices.</p>

			<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Posting the new Privacy Policy on this page</li>
				<li>Updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy</li>
